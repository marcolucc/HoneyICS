# HoneyICS

## Abstract


Industrial control systems (ICSs)  automate industrial processes in many  critical domains such as electric power distribution, nuclear power production, and water supply. 
HoneyICS is an high-interaction, physics-aware, scalable, reconfigurable  and extensible honeynet for ICSs that can be deployed both in research environments to analyze new attacks,  and in production environments to detect and possibly stop attacks to real ICS/SCADA devices.
